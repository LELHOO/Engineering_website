        <p> I did tinkercad stuff and started to make a rube goldberg machine + I made a toaster in tinkercad!!!! wow. I could have made the toaster look better and I can certainly improve my tinkercad skills but I think I did good!!! lol

<p>Log #4 9-16-22 this week I made progress with my rube goldberg machine project and we have begun working on it, from time to time I help my group with telling them the measurements and sometimes helping them with other stuff, so I think I should probably help them more, oh and one last thing I missed a day (first day of school that I missed this year) so I can't do the boat challenge which makes me sad ;(
</p>
<p>Next week I am going to finish my rube goldberg machine and we are going to test it out so I really have to try my best to participate and help my group because I want them to have da best score for this project!!!

<p>log #6 9-30-22
This week Mr Poole was gone cuz of covid and we had substitute teachers for the entire week, it was kind of a boring week I can't lie, when I was done with work for the week I was doing nothing so it was pretty boring
however, I did do something. I made a prosthetic for a manatee, here is what it looks like.

  log #7 10-7-22 
  This week I was gone for 2 DAYS so I was literally able to do nothing, besides the challenge, I didn't get to experience the whole laptop dissection thing because I was gone (IM SAD) however I paired up with someone and estimated how much wheels (yes wheels!) how many wheels were on campus (wheels to move things around) we didn't do the best but it was kinda fun, the first day I wasn't absent I learend a little bit about computer parts or something and today I am updating my website, so this week was pretty sad. :(

Wow long time since website update, anyways this week we started to learn electric engineering, personally I think its the most complicated thing we are learning, because it requires math and stuff. Anyways, I started to practice using something called a breadboard on tinkercad, pretty confusing stuff so hopefully I can figure this thing out. So below I've got like two screenshots of that stuff, so enjoy it or something. Anyways that is what I did on the first week of november, this is gonna be a hard subject in engineering so good luck to me I guess.

    this log is just about more progress about this subject, so I have made the breadboard IRL and I also did a challenge this week. I did all of this with a partner, so we did a worksheet about recording the resistance and volts of parts of the breadboard or something. Also, we did a challenge this week about trying to convince my teacher to either write down one to a million or take a math class. My partner and I decided to try to convince him to do math instead of writing to a million, I couldn't tell if we were successful or not but at least we tried. So that leads us to today where I am writing this log, so yeah, down below is a photo of the IRL breadboard.
