<p>Log #4 9-16-22 this week I made progress with my rube goldberg machine project and we have begun working on it, from time to time I help my group with telling them the measurements and sometimes helping them with other stuff, so I think I should probably help them more, oh and one last thing I missed a day (first day of school that I missed this year) so I can't do the boat challenge which makes me sad ;(
</p>
<p>Next week I am going to finish my rube goldberg machine and we are going to test it out so I really have to try my best to participate and help my group because I want them to have da best score for this project!!!
